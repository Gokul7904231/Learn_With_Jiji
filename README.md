## About the Screen

The “Learn with Jiji” screen represents the landing interface of an AI-powered learning companion.
The goal of this screen is to provide users with a simple and friendly way to search for learning topics,
receive AI-generated explanations, and access related learning resources.

The screen contains:
- A header introducing Jiji as an AI learning companion
- A search input for user queries (mocked)
- An AI response card displaying a sample explanation
- Resource cards for learning materials such as presentations and videos

This screen focuses on clean UI design, proper layout, and modular Flutter widgets.
No backend or real AI integration is implemented, as the assignment is UI-focused.
